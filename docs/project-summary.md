# 🔬 Epiphany Project Story

**From idea to reality: Making microscopy accessible to everyone**

---

## 🌟 The Vision

**What if anyone could explore the microscopic world without breaking the bank?**

This project started with a simple observation: while professional microscopy equipment costs thousands of dollars, affordable USB microscopes (available for $15-50) have nearly the same optical capabilities. The only difference? The software.

We set out to change that.
